## Introduction
KartRider Rush+ is a mobile game developed by Nexon where players can compete and race each other. There are two main mode in the game: Speed race and Item race. Also there are solo mode and team mode. In this project, we will only talk about **team mode**, which is a team consists of 4 players.

**Speed race vs Item race**
In **speed race**, skill is all you need to win. There's no luck involved, so you can win even with a cheap kart if you're skilled enough.
Whether in **item race**, there's some luck involved, and your kart plays important role. There's a huge difference when you use one kart and another, because each kart has unique abilities.

**Average players vs Top players**
In the game, there is a noticeable difference between average players and top players: **win rate (%)**.
Top players are those people who have >75% win rate. They only lose to another top players and extremely lucky opponent.

## Problem
Knowing the game mechanism, I raise a question: **If both use the same karts and builds, what's the difference between average players and top players?**

In other word, how can top player be so good at the first place?
